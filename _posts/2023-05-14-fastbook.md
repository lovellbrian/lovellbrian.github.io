# Solving Issues in Codepaces to Run Fastbook

I've been trying to run the fastbook notebooks in a codespace, but I've been running into a few issues. I'm going to document them here as I solve the issues manually.

I created a codespace from fastai/fastbook and then opened `02_production.ipynb`.

- The first problem was that I could not run the notebook in vscode as there was no python interpreter
- This was solved by installing the vscode extension for notebooks by clicking on extensions and installing `Python`.
- Choose the kernel `Python 3.10.4`.  Do not choose the venv kernel.
- Then I needed `Jupyter` notebook support, so I installed the extensio `Jupyter`.
- Then in the first cell `import fastbook` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastbook'`
- So then I click the hamburger menu and selected `View/Teminal` and ran `pip install fastbook`
- `Fastbook` installs lots of libraries that you will need including `pytorch`. This took a while to run.
Now Bing search is not working. I guess this is why Jeremy started to use Duck Duck Go.
- There is a solution [at this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65706220/fast-ai-course-2020-httperror-401-client-error-permissiondenied-for-url).
- Finally got my key.  Inserted my key into 
    `key = os.environ.get('AZURE_SEARCH_KEY', 'ThisIsNotMyKey')'
- Hooray! now I have 150 bear images.
- Needed to change the line `bear_types =  'grizzly','black','teddy' ` to `bear_types = [ 'grizzly','black','teddys' ]` do it is a python list.
- Had to delete the `bears` folder to refresh bear data.
- After running the code we should have three folders inside `bears`.  They are `black`, `grizzly`, and `teddy`.

## This is too freaking hard

My next solution is to add a devcontainer folder to fastbook so that I can run the notebooks in a docker container.  

I just copied the devcontainer folder from fast/ai/course22 to fastbook.  I then opened the folder in vscode and clicked on the green button to open the folder in a container.  I then opened the `02_production.ipynb` notebook and ran the first cell.  It worked!  I now have 150 bear images.

- The only issue I now had was that I had to install the `Jupyter` extension.

Happy DevContainering,

Brian
