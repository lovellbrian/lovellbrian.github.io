# External Access to Machines in 78-336

This post is just for my UQ Students.

You should be able to access the GPU Machines in 78-336 from home or anywhere as follows.

Use Remote Desktop Protocol to connect via rdp as per these [ITIG Instructions](https://help.eait.uq.edu.au/remote/#rdp). Connect to the server `rdp.labs.eait.uq.edu.au`.  Log in with your normal UQ credentials and use `DUO` for authentication.  Note that the `DUO` notification will provide a 4-digit code you must provide in addition to simply accepting the notification. Once in, you should be presented with a set of machines that you can access externally.  Choose the Deep Learning Machine Lab and connect.  You will be randomly allocated a machine.  

Let me know if you have any problems. 

Happy coding on your personal Linux GPU Container.
