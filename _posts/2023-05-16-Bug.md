# Bug in 00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb from fastai/course22

Dear Students,

There is a bug in an external library making the searches fail when searching for the same term twice within a short time in 00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb from fastai/course22.  

This a [known issue](ddg_images() works only once · Issue #60 · deedy5/duckduckgo_search (github.com)) in the fastai forum that has just happened in the last week or two. It can be fixed as follows.

Here is the solution I just tested.

First make sure you have fastbook installed as we will use the `search_images_ddg` function from there. 

At the terminal type `pip install fastbook`.

Now fetch `search_images_ddg` from fastbook.

After the line *Let's start by searching for a bird photo and seeing what kind of result we get. We'll start by getting URLs from a search:* we fix the cell by replacing it with:

    from fastbook import search_images_ddg
    urls = search_images_ddg('bird photos', max_images=1)
    urls[0]

After this line *Now let's do the same with "forest photos":* we fix the cell by replacing it with:

    download_url(search_images_ddg('forest photos', max_images=1)[0], 'forest.jpg', show_progress=False)
    Image.open('forest.jpg').to_thumb(256,256)

Finally we fix the cell after *Our searches seem to be giving reasonable results, so let's grab 200 examples of each of "bird" and "forest" photos, and save each group of photos to a different folder:* by replacing it with:

    searches = 'forest','bird'
    path = Path('bird_or_not')
    from time import sleep

    for o in searches:
        dest = (path/o)
        dest.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
        download_images(dest, urls=search_images_ddg(f'{o} photo'))
        sleep(10)  # Pause between searches to avoid over-loading server
        download_images(dest, urls=search_images_ddg(f'{o} sun photo'))
        sleep(10)
        download_images(dest, urls=search_images_ddg(f'{o} shade photo'))
        sleep(10)
        resize_images(path/o, max_size=400, dest=path/o)

This should fix all the searches.

Happy fastai-ing,

Brian
