## Running My Class on Dev-Containers

Well, I am teaching ELEC4630 Computer Vision and Deep Learning using Jeremy Howard's [fastai](https://www.fastai.com) courses as the main teaching tool.  My class uses devcontainers to run the code with or without gpu on the UQ deep learning PCs with GPU support.

This seems to be working out well and the students are being introduced to the joys of Visual Studio Code, Unix System Administration, and Jupyter notebooks - all using devcontainers.

Why do I prefer this method of teaching for deep learning? Well, the biggest advantage is that the students have an identical copy of my machine including all the software config. All they have to do is get Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Docker Desktop, and Visual Studio Code up and running. This takes about 30 minutes. Then they simply run all the devcontainers from GitHub and they can access their machines gpu.  So there are no Unix configuration and no library incompatibilities to worry about. If there is a problem, I can fix the devcontainer image on GitHUB without consulting the IT Group to correct the image.

The IT Group only support networked PCs using Windows, but deep learning must really be taught using Unix.  Also, the students really need root privileges to install certain libraries. This can be done with WSL. However, then the problem is that the students need to install so many libraries on WSL to run a deep learning example notebook that it is impossible to support them.  By running the devcontainer, they get Unix root access and also get all the necessary libraries installed because the complete devcontainer machine is specified on GitHub. They can also make a fork of the repository and commit their modified source to GitHub for assignment submission. In general, the fork must be Private rather than Public, but I have figured out how to do this.

So why not simply use free gpu resources on Codespaces, Collab or Kaggle? The trouble is that these resources require a credit card and will bill you if you use them too much. Now some of my students may not have a credit card and I simply don't want them paying anything. Also, Collab and Kaggle keep modifying their engine to the latest library versions and this may cause notebook code to break at awkward times.  Codespaces is ok, but they charge students for gpu access. I can't run a course where I have no control over the environment. Also, I cannot assist students on Kaggle and Collab because I don't have access to their accounts to see what is wrong.  This is also a major problem using AWS services. With devcontainers, everyone starts with an identical disk image which remains stable until I issue a new one.

Devcontainers can be run for free on our UQ Deep learning Lab. Also, these machines are available remotely, so students can access from anywhere at any time. In addition, they can run the same GitHub code on their personal laptop or desktop with or without gpu. 

At the end of the deep learning course, students can to take this environment as far as they like. I have debugged all of Jeremy's code, so it runs smoothly. That means that the students now have the environment to run all of his notebooks and continue their learning journey.

Enjoy!

Happy coding on your devcontainers.
