# DockerFiles and Devcontainers

I am working on my code anywhere container project and this has taken me into the inner workings of containers.

Now I have finally worked out that Dockerfiles are largely to do with Docker and devcontainer files are part of vscode. This is why I could not find much documentation on devcontainer files until I looked at the vscode documentation.

Happy Containerising,

Brian
