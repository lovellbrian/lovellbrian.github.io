# How can I fork a public repository, but make my fork private?

First create a new repository on GitHub.  Make sure it is a private repository.

Then go into VS Code and type F1 `WSL:Connect to WSL` so you are working in Linux. Open a terminal window and type

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```console
git clone --bare https://github.com/lovellbrian/<my-public-repository>
```
(for example, for `fastbook` type in `git clone --bare https://github.com/lovellbrian/fastbook`)

Then `cd` into the new directory.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```console
cd <my-public-repository>
```
Finally clone it up to your new private repo on GitHub that you just created.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```console
git clone --bare https://github.com/<yourusername>/<private-repo>
```

For a full explanation take a look at  [Stack Exchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10065526/github-how-to-make-a-fork-of-public-repository-private).

First, duplicate the repo:

Create a new repo (let's call it private-repo) via the Github UI. Then:

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```console
git clone --bare https://github.com/exampleuser/public-repo.git
cd public-repo.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/yourname/private-repo.git
cd ..
rm -rf public-repo.git
```

Clone the private repo so you can work on it:

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```console
git clone https://github.com/yourname/private-repo.git
cd private-repo
make some changes
git commit
git push origin master
```

To pull new changes from the public repo:

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```console
cd private-repo
git remote add public https://github.com/exampleuser/public-repo.git
git pull public master # Creates a merge commit
git push origin master
```

Awesome, your private repo now has the latest code from the public repo plus your changes.

Finally, to create a pull request private repo -> public repo:

Use the GitHub UI to create a fork of the public repo (the small "Fork" button at the top right of the public repo page). Then:

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```console
git clone https://github.com/yourname/the-fork.git
cd the-fork
git remote add private_repo_yourname https://github.com/yourname/private-repo.git
git checkout -b pull_request_yourname
git pull private_repo_yourname master
git push origin pull_request_yourname
```
Now you can create a pull request via the Github UI for public-repo, as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Once project owners review your pull request, they can merge it.

Of course the whole process can be repeated (just leave out the steps where you add remotes). 

Enjoy!

Happy coding on your private fork on GitHub.
