# Running Code in a DevContainer instead of Codespaces

## Introduction

You can run code in a DevContainer instead of Codespaces. This is very useful if you want to run linux code locally on your own windows machine, or if you want to run code on a machine that is not a Codespace. For example, you might want to run code on a Raspberry Pi, or on a machine in the lab.

Read this [article](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to learn more about DevContainers. Also look up [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) if you are not familiar with this wonderful code.  A Docker image can be used to run a full linux machine on windows, or even a full linux machine on a Raspberry Pi.

Here is a [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) on the topic. 

Happy DevContainering,

Brian
