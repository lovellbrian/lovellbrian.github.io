# How to set up a Discussion Board in GitHub

I wanted to set up a discussion board similar to the GitHub Community. First I tried to do this through my existing University-of-Queensland-Lovell community.  The problem was that posters would need to be members of the community instead of outside collaborators.  This would give them rights to see all repositories which is very undesirable as I use this account for student teaching.

For this reason, I created a new organisation UQ-Lovell and created a repository fastaiClub to host the discussions. This is how, and likely, why GitHub community is set up this way. 

Try out the new [discussion board](https://github.com/UQ-Lovell/fastaiClub/discussions/3) and see what you think.
