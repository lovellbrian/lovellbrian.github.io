# Templates for GitHub Classroom Assignments

I forked a copy of Jeremy's course22 fastai repository.  I use this as follows:

1. Send pull requests to Jeremy to update the fastai course material
2. Use as a template for GitHub Classroom assignments
3. Branch off to work on major changes to code.

My intention was to use one of the branches as the template for the course so I could make local corrections for classroom distribution.  Unfortunately templates remove all the branch and history information so only the main branch is used to create repositories. 

So the solution appears to be that I should modify the main branch for class customisations. Then I can use the other branches to make suggested improvements to the fastai/course22 repository for pull requests.  There is a great deal to learn in this journey, but I am sure having fun. I just love Git, GitHub, VSCode, GitHub Desktop, and, of course, fastai.  

Well done, Jeremy.
