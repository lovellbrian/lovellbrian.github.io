# Uploading Notebooks to Google Colab from Drive and GitHub to access the GPU

Students should have fastai notebooks in a repository on GitHub as well as a repository on Google Drive.


In this case your simply open Google Colab and select File/Upload Notebook.  Now you can either upload the notebook from Drive or GitHub. 
Next select Runtime/Change Runtime Type and select the GPU option.  Now you are ready to run your code on a GPU.  Training on the bird example will only take about 5 seconds per epoch with a GPU

You can test and edit your code in Colab and save the modified code back to either Drive or Github  using File/Save a copy in Drive or File/Save a copy in GitHub.

Happy Coding, 
Brian
