## This is my First post just to try out GitHub Pages

Jeremy Howard recommends starting a blog to document FastAi progress. So here I am.  Even this took me more time than I care to admit.

I had some build errors and finally found out that I had to write my Twitter handle as LovellProf instead of @LovellProf. As always little things make for big errors.
