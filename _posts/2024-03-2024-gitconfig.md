# Automatically Setting Git Credentials in Containers

Following this [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/sharing-git-credentials), you will be able to automatically set your Git credentials in your containers. This is very convenient to allow you to push and pull from your repositories from a container without having to enter your credentials every time.

in Windows type
```console
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@address"
```

This will create a file in your Windows home directory called .gitconfig. You can also create this file manually and it will look something like this:

```console
[filter "lfs"]
	smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
	process = git-lfs filter-process
	required = true
	clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
[user]
	name = <user.name>
	email = <user.email>
[core]
	editor = \"C:\\Users\\<user.accountname>.GS709B-6185\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\bin\\code\" --wait
```
If all is well, you can simply close and restart VS Code and your Git credentials will be automatically set in your containers.

If not, your VS code settings are probably wrong.  Open the settings and search for git. Make sure **Copy Git Config** is ticked and then click on this box. A settings cog will now appear. Click on this cog and select **Sync this Setting**.

Enjoy easy git credential management in your containers.
