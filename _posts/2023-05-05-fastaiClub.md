# Introduction to the UQ fastai Club

I have set up a GitHub Community which I call the fastAIClub.  The idea is that people who studying the fastAI course delivered at UQ (especially my ELEC4630, thesis. or RHD students) can join the Club and discuss their work and AI in general.  The [discussion board](https://github.com/UQ-Lovell/fastaiClub/discussions) is public, so anyone can read the posts.  However, if you want to post, you will need to contact me with your GitHub user name so I can add you. 

Try out this [poll](https://github.com/UQ-Lovell/fastaiClub/discussions/3) and leave your opinion on this course.  Be aware that Jeremy (jph00) might join in from time to time.
