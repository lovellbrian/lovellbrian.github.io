## Visual Studio Code and fast ai

I believe that fastai should always be in lower case, so I have modified my blogs to follow convention.  I am using Visual Studio Code as my editor for now.  It appears to have replaces Atom as a Git aware multi language IDE.  There are lots of choices, but I'll stick with Visual Studio code for now.   Visual Studio Code is free and open, just like Atom.  Atom is no longer [supported](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/), so that is why I am switching.
