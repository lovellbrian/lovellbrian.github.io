## Managing Memory in Docker

I am running some face recognition code and the code kept terminating with SIGKILL or SIGNAL 9.  This kind of termination is most likely due to running out of  memory in the docker container.  So how to we increase memory on Docker running on Windows?

First, here is an image of my container running out of memory.

Note that the CPU usage at the top left is over 100%. That is because this metric is based on one CPU and I am running 8.  So 500% utilization is not unusual. 

Memory is 16G which half of what I actually have on my 32G machine.  At some point the container needs more than 16G and this results in the following message.

```console
enroll() --> templ size: 2048 id: 1309 - OK
[03:59:37] /home/tihamer/from_git/mxnet/src/executor/graph_executor.cc:2076: Subgraph backend MKLDNN is activated.
PID 32234 exited due to signal 9
[ERROR] Enrollment validation (single process) failed
```

Not nice at all.  So we need more memory than 16G and we have 32G of real memory available.
