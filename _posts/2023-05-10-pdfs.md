# Linking to a PDF from GitHub Pages

This turns out to be trickier than it sounds due to GitHub Pages scrambling the URLs.  The [best solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30745981/opening-pdf-in-a-browser-with-github-pages) seems to be as follows. Note that I created a new folder for my pdfs.

Use the syntax:
`[bird's notebook]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.pdf)`

instead of
`[bird's notebook]({{ site.baseurl }}/00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.pdf)`

You can see this example in the previous post.  

Happy GitHub Paging, 


Brian
