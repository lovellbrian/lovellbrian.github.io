# Preserving Codespace Hours by Stopping Containers

According to the GitHub Codespaces documentation, students get up to 180 core hours[^1] per month, which is quite a lot.  I did not think anyone would reach this, but one student has. From now on, please make sure you stop  your machine when  you disconnect as per the instructions  below, unless you are training.


## Stopping your Codespace

Happy Codespacing,

[^1]: Note that a core hour is the time in hours by the number of cores in your machine. So a 16 core machine uses 16 core hours in one physical hour.
