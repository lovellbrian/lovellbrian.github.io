## Brian Lovell's Awesome fastai Blog

I am a Professor at The University of Queensland and I have many AI research projects underway and lots of opportunities for PhD studies. I have recently started to use [fastai](https://www.fast.ai) and the purpose of this blog is simply to document my journey.  

I am also experimenting with running a [full ecommerce wordpress site](https://vicki.com.au) to gain experience in social media and marketing in the real world.  I just love managing public websites and unix servers.  In fact, I believe I wrote the very first website for my research group way back in 1995 using an NCSA proxy caching server --- this was well before UQ established its own web presence in 1998. Those were the good old days of the early internet. Please get in touch if you have any feedback or questions.
