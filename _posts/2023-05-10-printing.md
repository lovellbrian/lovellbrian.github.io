# Printing your Notebooks

You may have noticed that printing a notebook from a browser gives you very ugly, badly formatted output.  Fortunately, there is a better way and it is available from VS Code itself.  It is called [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and it prints notebooks using XeLaTeX based on the [XeTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX) engine. This is an update of [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) engine supporting a wider range of typography. 

## How do we print from VSCode?

Open your notebook in VSCode and left click on the `...` symbol.  Select `Export` and then `Export` to PDF.  Choose the destination folder and export.   If there are errors in the export process, nothing will be output.  Simply correct the errors and retry.  In my case I had trouble prining the birds example and I needed to delete the attached image. 

So there you go, the output looks great!  Take a look at the [bird's notebook](images/00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.pdf) I printed today.

Happy GitHub Printing, 

Brian
